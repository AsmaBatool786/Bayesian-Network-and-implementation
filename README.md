# Bayesian-Network-and-implementation
Bayesian Network is a probabilistic graphical model for representing knowledge about an uncertain domain that helps make predictions under uncertainty. It consists of nodes and edges where each node corresponds to a random variable and each edge represents conditional probability for the for the corresponding random variables. Bayesian Networks are also called belief networks or Bayes nets.
